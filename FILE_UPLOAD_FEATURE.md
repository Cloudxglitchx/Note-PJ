### File Storage
- Files converted to **base64** format
- Stored in **localStorage** with note
- Embedded in note data
- No server needed!

### File Structure
```javascript
{
  id: 123456,
  name: "diagram.png",
  type: "image/png",
  size: 245678,  // bytes
  data: "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."  // base64
}
```

### Size Limits
- **Per file**: 5MB maximum
- **Total**: Limited by browser localStorage (~5-10MB total)
- **Warning**: Shows if file too large
- **Recommendation**: Keep files small
