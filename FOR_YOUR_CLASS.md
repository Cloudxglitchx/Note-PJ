## 💾 How Data is Stored

- **User accounts**: Saved in browser localStorage
- **Notes & votes**: Saved in browser localStorage
- **Works offline**: No internet needed after first load
- **Per device**: Each device has its own data

**Note:** Since it uses localStorage, data is stored locally on each device. For shared data across devices, you'd need to deploy with a backend (Firebase).

## 🔄 Want Everyone to See Same Notes?

**Current:** Each person sees their own notes  
**To Share:** You need to either:
1. Deploy with Firebase (cloud storage)
2. Use a shared backend
3. Export/import notes manually

## 🎯 Next Steps to Make It Better

1. **Add "Create Note" button** - Let students add notes
2. **Add comments** - Discuss notes
3. **Deploy online** - So everyone can access
4. **Add Firebase** - For real-time sync
5. **File uploads** - Attach PDFs, images

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Can't access from another device"**
- Make sure you're on same WiFi
- Check firewall settings
- Try deploying online instead

**"Lost my notes"**
- Notes are in browser localStorage
- Clearing browser data deletes notes
- Back up important notes!

**"Want to reset everything"**
- Browser console (F12)
- Type: `localStorage.clear()`
- Refresh page
