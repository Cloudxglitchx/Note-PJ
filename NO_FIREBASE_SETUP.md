## 🔒 How It Works

### localStorage Authentication

Instead of Firebase, this version uses browser localStorage:

1. **User accounts** stored in `localStorage.users`
2. **Current session** stored in `localStorage.currentUser`
3. **No server** required - everything runs in browser
4. **No configuration** needed - works instantly!

### Data Storage

```javascript
// Users stored like this:
[
  {
    email: "demo@student.com",
    password: "demo123",
    name: "Demo Student",
    role: "student"
  }
]

// Current user session:
{
  email: "demo@student.com",
  name: "Demo Student",
  role: "student"
}
```

## 🔄 Switching to Firebase Later

Want to upgrade to Firebase later? Easy!

1. Follow [GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md](GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md)
2. Replace `login-simple.html` with `login.html`
3. Replace `auth-simple.js` with `auth.js`
4. Replace `index-simple.html` with `index.html`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Not redirecting after login"**
- Make sure you're using `http://localhost:8000`
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

**"Lost my account"**
- Accounts are stored in browser localStorage
- Clearing browser data will delete accounts
- Use demo account: demo@student.com / demo123

**"Want to reset everything"**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Type: `localStorage.clear()`
- Refresh page - demo accounts will be recreated
